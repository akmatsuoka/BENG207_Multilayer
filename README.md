Fig 1 — Transmission spectrum |T(f)| from 15–25 MHz for four couplant thicknesses (5, 15, 30, 50 µm), fresh vs degraded gel

Fig 2a/2b — Sensitivity maps |T| vs (h₂, η₂) at fixed E₂, and |T| vs (h₂, E₂) at fixed η₂ — two heatmaps showing which couplant parameter matters more

Fig 3 — Phase shift during degradation — tracks how gel aging (stiffening + thinning) shifts the transmission phase and displaces the standing wave nodes

Fig 4 — Degradation evolution — six time snapshots of the spectrum (17–23 MHz) as gel degrades from fresh to old

Fig 5 — Couplant attenuation — frequency-dependent attenuation (dB/mm) and phase velocity in the gel for four viscosity values (0.5, 2, 10, 50 Pa·s)

Fig 6 — Broadband sweep |T(f)| from 1–100 MHz for five transducer thicknesses (330, 165, 110, 82, 66 µm), each targeting a different center frequency (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 MHz) — shows how 
changing h₄ opens up different frequency bands

Fig 7 — Optimal couplant thickness vs frequency — for each frequency from 1–80 MHz, sweeps h₂ and finds the thickness that maximizes |T|, also reports |T| at four fixed thicknesses (1, 5, 20, 50 µm) for comparison

Fig 8 — Glass resonance interaction map — 2D heatmap of |T(f, h₃)| showing how glass thickness (0.1–3 mm) creates periodic transmission windows at its resonance harmonics f_n = n·c₃/(2h₃)

Fig 9 — Multi-parameter design optimization — brute-force grid search over (h₂, h₃, h₄) simultaneously for eight target frequencies (5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80 MHz), reports optimal geometry and maximum |T| for each
